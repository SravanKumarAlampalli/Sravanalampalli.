  <h1>Business Analysis Toolkit for Healthcare Transformation</h1>
  <p>
    My work begins where ambiguity lives. In complex healthcare environments—claims operations, utilization management, 
    provider networks, and compliance workflows—I translate strategy into clear, testable requirements and govern the
    delivery lifecycle with disciplined Agile practices. The outcome is predictable execution: fewer escalations, faster
    value realization, and demonstrable improvements in member and patient outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>How I De-Risk Delivery in Regulated Environments</h2>
  <p>
    I create BRDs/FRDs/SRS aligned to HIPAA and HITECH constraints; design user stories with unambiguous acceptance criteria; 
    and facilitate JAD sessions that surface edge cases before they become defects. My toolset includes 
    <em>requirements traceability (RTM)</em>, <em>GAP/impact analysis</em>, <em>risk registers</em>, and 
    <em>release-ready change packets</em> that help IT and Compliance move in lockstep.
  </p>

  <h2>Delivery Results (Representative)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>20% increase</strong> in team productivity by tightening Scrum ceremonies and backlog quality (refined epics → shippable slices).</li>
    <li><strong>15% reduction</strong> in rework via pre-sprint consensus (JAD + acceptance test read-throughs with business & QA).</li>
    <li><strong>100% traceability</strong> from business objectives to testable stories and release outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Toolkit Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    BRD/FRD/SRS authoring • Story mapping & acceptance criteria • UAT planning and sign-off • 
    GAP & impact analysis across claims/member workflows • Stakeholder workshops • Risk controls • 
    Audit-friendly documentation structure built for healthcare oversight.
