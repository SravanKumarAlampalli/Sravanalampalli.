  <h1>SQL & Insurance Analytics for Outcome-Driven Decisions</h1>
  <p>
    Health plans and insurers succeed when decisions are grounded in trustworthy data. I build SQL-driven analytical 
    assets—validation queries, KPI logic, cohort definitions—that executives use to steer programs and ensure regulatory 
    readiness. From claims timeliness to policy renewal dynamics, my focus is actionable, reproducible analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytical Focus Areas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Claims Lifecycle Intelligence:</strong> submission → adjudication → denial/appeal; SLA adherence; avoidable rework detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Member & Provider Insights:</strong> segment performance, leakage patterns, network utilization, and cost-to-serve.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance & Audit Support:</strong> audit trails, reconciliation scripts, and report logic that withstands scrutiny.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Measured Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>20% fewer reporting errors</strong> by instituting validation queries and baseline data quality checks.</li>
    <li><strong>15% faster</strong> decision cycles with executive-ready metrics on policy renewal and claims trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Breadth</h2>
  <p>
    SQL (MySQL/Oracle) • Data validation & profiling • Denormalization for BI • KPI contracts for Tableau/Power BI •
    Documentation that aligns metric definitions with business policy for consistent, audit-proof reporting.
