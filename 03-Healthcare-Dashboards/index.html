  <h1>Healthcare Dashboards that Create Compliance & Command</h1>
  <p>
    A dashboard is only valuable if it changes behavior. I design Tableau/Power BI experiences that give leaders a 
    single source of truth on claims timeliness, compliance posture, and member outcomes—so they can intervene early, 
    allocate resources precisely, and demonstrate control to regulators and boards.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Principles I Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Executive signal over noise:</strong> prioritized KPIs (SLA, denial drivers, backlog health) with drill-downs by line of business, region, and provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational alignment:</strong> views map to real teams and cadences (daily standups → weekly ops → month-end compliance).</li>
    <li><strong>Trust & repeatability:</strong> KPI definitions documented and tied back to SQL logic for auditability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcomes Delivered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>20+</strong> executive-level healthcare dashboards delivered on DataBricks-backed datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>25% reduction</strong> in manual reporting time and higher confidence in compliance submissions.</li>
    <li>Faster, more accurate decisions across claims, member experience, and regulatory reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where This Helps Immediately</h2>
  <p>
    Compliance reporting, capitation/claims cost tracking, utilization review visibility, denial prevention programs, 
    and operational readiness for audits and corrective action plans.
