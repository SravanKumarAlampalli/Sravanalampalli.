  <h1>Case Studies: From Insight to Impact in Healthcare</h1>
  <p>
    Below are representative outcomes from my recent roles. Each example pairs disciplined analysis with pragmatic delivery, 
    producing measurable improvements in efficiency, compliance confidence, and stakeholder satisfaction.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Claims Optimization — National Health Plan</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Redundant validation steps and unclear ownership slowed adjudication and elevated denial risk.<br>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Conducted GAP/impact analysis across claims intake and member management; re-authored user stories 
    with crisp acceptance criteria; created executive dashboards to monitor cycle time and SLA adherence.<br>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> <strong>25% efficiency gain</strong> in claims operations; rework down; escalations reduced; 
    improved readiness for compliance audits.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Insurance Analytics — Policy & Claims Insights</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Leaders lacked trustworthy views of policy renewals and claims trends.<br>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Built SQL models and BI KPIs with documented metric definitions; instituted validation queries and 
    governance around logic changes; educated stakeholders on interpretation.<br>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> <strong>20% fewer reporting errors</strong> and <strong>15% faster</strong> decision cycles; 
    clearer prioritization for product and compliance teams.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Agile Enablement — Delivery Cadence & Predictability</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Work entered sprints ambiguously, creating churn and missed expectations.<br>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Introduced story mapping, JAD pre-reads, and DoR/DoD standards; tightened feedback loops with QA and business.<br>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> <strong>20% productivity uplift</strong> and <strong>15% less rework</strong>; consistent sprint finishes; 
    stakeholders gained confidence in release plans.
