<h1>Certifications & Continuous Learning</h1>
<p>Modern healthcare demands fluency in both compliance and technology. My certifications reinforce the foundation I bring to regulated, data-intensive programs.</p>

<h2>AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate</h2>
<p>Validates the ability to design secure, highly available architectures on AWS. In practice, this means applying encryption, IAM least-privilege, network segmentation, and cost-aware storage/compute choices that align with HIPAA safeguards.</p>

<h2>SAS Certified Specialist — Base Programming (9.4)</h2>
<p>Demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, statistical procedures, and automation for repeatable analytics—useful for actuarial-adjacent analysis, audit requests, and legacy data modernization.</p>

<h2>How This Shows Up in Delivery</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compliance-aware designs:</strong> PHI minimization, masked datasets for BI, and documented lineage.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational reliability:</strong> resilient pipelines, observability, and rollback strategies for zero-surprise releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Actionable analytics:</strong> KPI definitions that are stable, explainable, and trusted by executives and auditors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuous learning keeps my toolkit aligned with evolving payer/provider needs, analytics best practices, and regulatory expectations.</p>
